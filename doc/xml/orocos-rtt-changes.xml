    Please consult the online wiki for all available information about
    the 1.x to 2.x transition:
    <ulink
    url="http://www.orocos.org/wiki/rtt/rtt-20">The Road to RTT 2.0</ulink>.
    The Real-Time Toolkit is no longer released as a single entity, but as part
    of a complete set of tools and libraries for creating real-time applications.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  This release is binary incompatible with RTT
	  &oldversion;.x. You need to upgrade and recompile all your applications
	  in order to use this release.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  On Linux, the 2.0.x releases loaded every plugin or
	  component library which filename had ".so" in it. This
	  version only loads libraries <emphasis>ending</emphasis> in
	  ".so".

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    You can now use the 'autoproj' tool to download, build and update the
	    Orocos Toolchain. Bootstrapping is done with the 'bootstrap.sh' file,
	    which will install autoproj and all Orocos libraries. See the
	    <ulink url="http://www.orocos.org/wiki/orocos/toolchain/quick-start">Quick Start wiki</ulink>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    You no longer need a FindOrocosRTT.cmake file to detect the RTT and
	    its dependencies in cmake projects. The Orocos toolchain installs
	    a cmake config file in <filename>&lt;prefix>/lib/cmake/orocos-rtt/orocos-rtt-config.cmake</filename> which
	    you can use by calling <command>find_package(OROCOS-RTT)</command>. We
	    are preparing more helper macros to ease component and application building.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    When using autoproj to configure the build, the default
	    install directory defaults to
	    <filename>orocos-toolchain/install</filename>. The autoproj
	    build is configured in the autoproj/ subdirectory of the toolchain.

      <title>OS Abstraction</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Windows targets are better supported than ever, although broader testing
	    wouldn't hurt. Xenomai, Mac OS-X and Gnu/Linux are very well supported.
	    We need more feedback from users on the RTAI/LXRT front.

    <section>
      <title>TaskContext</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Adding primitives to TaskContexts has been greatly
	    simplified. In most cases, no helper objects are
	    necessary. Take a look at the examples or documentation
	    how properties, operations and ports are added to a
	    TaskContext. The <command>rtt2-converter</command> script
	    rewrites all your 1.x components to use the new syntax.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The Data Flow has been completely reworked. Buffering and locking policies are
	    now set on a per-connection basis. The only two port types that exist are
	    <classname>RTT::InputPort</classname> and <classname>RTT::OutputPort</classname>.
	    The rtt-conversion tool renames all your ports and does a best-effort to
	    discover to what it should be converted.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Marshalling (XML reading/writing of parameters) and scripting have become
	    plugins. Only components that make use of it will allocate memory for these
	    services. (See also Caveats).
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

    <section>
      <title>Data Types, Toolkits and Typekits</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The term Toolkit has been renamed to Typekit. Users should not write typekits
	    themselves and use the <command>typegen</command> tool instead. It parses C++ headers and generates
	    type info, corba and mqueue transports from it. A typekit generator for ROS
	    is also available, separately from typegen.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Orocos knows the complete structure of your registered data types, and provides some
	    default functions for serializing (XML) and accessing (scripting) these structures.
	    In case you need to extend this functionality (like adding operators or an alternative
	    XML representation) you still need to hand-code these functions, since typegen
	    has no knowledge for generating such code.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Corba Transport</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Reading and writing ports that are connected to ports of
	    components in other processes is always real-time. A
	    back-ground thread will do the non-real-time dispatching
	    of the port data over the network.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Corba transport typekits (former toolkits) are now
	    automatically generated from plain C++ headers with the
	    <command>typegen</command> tool.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>POSIX MQueue Transport</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    A new transport for hard real-time data flow communication between components
	    on the same host but in different processes has been added. It is
	    based on POSIX MQueues and is supported on the GNU/Linux and Xenomai targets.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ROS Transport</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    A code generator for ROS typekits is available, which turns ROS messages
	    into Orocos types, which can be used in scripting and data flow communication.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    It is currently in beta-development, but no known issues exist at the moment.
	    It allows to connect Orocos components to ROS nodes, without the need for
	    a special deployer. The standard OCL DeploymentComponent can set up these
	    connections.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    
	  </para>

      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Scripting</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The 'do' and 'set' keywords are now optional. For example:
	    <programlisting> // old 1.x style:
 var bool status = false
 do comp.connectToHMI()
 set status = comp.isConnected()

 // new 2.0 style:
 var bool status = false
 comp.connectToHMI()
 status = comp.isConnected()
	    </programlisting>
	    The 'var' keyword still remains mandatory.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Corba transport typekits (former toolkits) are now automatically generated 
	    from plain C++ headers with the <command>typegen</command> tool.
	    Do not hand-write custom typekits or transports for CORBA.
	  </para>

    <title>Orocos Component Library (OCL)</title>
    <section>
      <title>Caveats</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This release is binary incompatible with OCL
	    &oldversion;.x. You need to recompile all your applications
	    in order to upgrade to this release.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Most components have been removed from this library.
	    Only these modules remain:
	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem><para>reporting</para> </listitem>
	      <listitem><para>deployment</para> </listitem>
	      <listitem><para>helloworld</para> </listitem>

	      <listitem><para>logging</para> </listitem>
	      <listitem><para>timer</para> </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	    All removed components are to be picked up by users that
	    wish to maintain them. A central place for looking up
	    such repositories will be made available on the 
	    Orocos Toolchain home page.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Deployment</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Creating component libraries has slightly changed.
	    You must now use the <option>-DRTT_COMPONENT</option>
	    flag during compiling instead of <option>-DOCL_DLL_EXPORT</option>.
	    The latter is still accepted during this release but may break 
	    in future releases.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Also the header <filename>ocl/ComponentLoader.hpp</filename> has
	    been renamed to <filename>ocl/Component.hpp</filename>. The
	    rtt2-converter script takes care of this renaming.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    It is no longer required to link with OCL if you create a
	    component using -DRTT_COMPONENT and including &lt;ocl/Component.hpp>.
	    Your libraries only need to link with the RTT library.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The DeploymentComponent expects components and plugins to be installed
	    in a specific directory structure. Each directory to look for components
	    must be mentioned in the RTT_COMPONENT_PATH environment variable or
	    DeploymentComponent property. For each directory in RTT_COMPONENT_PATH,
	    the subdirectories <filename>plugins/</filename> and <filename>types/</filename>
	    are searched for plugins and typekits respectively. You may set 
	    RTT_COMPONENT_PATH similar to how the PATH variable is set on your
	    Operating System.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For example:
	    <programlisting> RTT_COMPONENT_PATH=/opt/2.0/lib/orocos:/opt/2.0/lib/testing
  # Searches for components in '/opt/2.0/lib/orocos/*.[so|dll]' and '/opt/2.0/lib/testing/*.[so|dll]'
  # Searches for plugins in '/opt/2.0/lib/orocos/plugins/*.[so|dll]' and '/opt/2.0/lib/testing/plugins/*.[so|dll]'
  # Searches for typekits in '/opt/2.0/lib/orocos/types/*.[so|dll]' and '/opt/2.0/lib/testing/types/*.[so|dll]'	
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    You can no longer <function>import()</function> 'normal' libraries into the process in order to resolve
	    missing symbols in your components. You need to link your component to the correct
	    library, or create a plugin for that library.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    You can now specify connection policies for data flow connections between ports.
	    The 1.x scheme still exists, but for each connection name, you can specify 
	    if it needs to be buffered, which protocol to use, etc. See
	    <classname>RTT::ConnPolicy</classname>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    You can now create streamed connections, which creates a stream to or from a port.
	    This is used by the POSIX mqueue transport and the ROS transport, which are
	    connection-less transports. The DeploymentComponent will automatically try
	    to create a stream if a connection only has one port.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Deployment now also works on the Windows platform.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
    <section>
    <title>TaskBrowser</title>
      <itemizedlist>      
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The TaskBrowser can be compiled with the 'editline' library, which is a
	    BSD-licensed alternative to the 'readline' libary, which is GPL.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The TaskBrowser can now create new variables (for
	    example<programlisting>var int i = 3</programlisting>,
	    which are stored in the current component, it accepts
	    multiple assignments, and shows and completes the data
	    structure of variables.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Other Improvements</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The ReportingComponent is more efficient and can quickly serialize data
	    due to better introspection mechanisms in the RTT. It can work event-based
	    (when new data is to be logged) or sample-based (scans all ports on a
	    regular basis).
	  </para>
